            <h2>What is Nooku Platform?</h2>
            <p>Nooku Platform was <a href="http://www.nooku.org/blog/2010/12/nooku-server-joomla-on-steroids/">born at the end of 2010</a>  with the goal to create a <a href="http://www.nooku.org/blog/2011/01/creating-a-diet-for-nooku-server/">leaner</a> and <a href="http://www.nooku.org/blog/2011/01/nooku-server-loses-40-weight/">meaner</a> multi-site and multi-lingual distro of <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla</a> 1.5 for the <a href="http://www.openpolice.be">Belgian Police</a>. Originally named Nooku Server and renamed to Nooku Platform in 2014.</p>
            <p>Compatibility with Joomla was dropped soon after Joomla 1.5 reached its end of life period on 2012. Since then, development continued in an effort to completely refactor the code base to a modern and lean architecture using well-established coding standards and best practices.</p>
            <p>At the moment Nooku Platform is at version 0.9 and work is ongoing to remove the last bits of Joomla legacy code. Once this work is completed a 1.0 alpha release will be made available.</p>

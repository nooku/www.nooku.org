Backbone.js, Joomla and Nooku possible? Absolutely! Nooku’s built-in JSON API makes it a great choice as a back-end for any kind of desktop and mobile app. Don’t believe us?

Our new tutorial ["Using Backbone.js with Nooku"](http://guides.nooku.org/tutorials/backbonejs-nooku-together.html) shows you how you can use TodoMVC’s Backbone.js example app as a frontend for our Joomla Todo extension.

## Backbone.js in a nutshell

The past 5 years have seen great advancements in client side use of Javascript libraries and frameworks. Asynchronous requests, partial page refreshes and the rise of the single page application are just a few examples of this. The explosion of mobile device apps that use Javascript and HTML5 is also a huge driver.  

## A trio made in heaven

Joomla together with Nooku and Backbone.js make for a killer team. With Joomla you get a great application administration interface. With Nooku you get an out of the box JSON web service for Backbone.js to talk too! An instant friendship.

Nooku makes building administration views for the data of your service quick and easy. Joomla brings the environment and Nooku brings the horsepower to add, edit, or delete records **without any code needing to be written**.

## Using Backbone.js with Nooku

Our [tutorial](http://guides.nooku.org/tutorials/backbonejs-nooku-together.html) takes you through each step and explain how you can use the REST API of our Joomla Todo extension as the back-end for the [TodoMVC.com Backbone.js example](http://todomvc.com/examples/backbone/).

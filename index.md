## Nooku's little history

More than 7 years ago we set out to create Nooku, a multi-lingual extension for Joomla as a side project of [Joomlatools](http://www.joomlatools.com/). A year later we launched Nooku Framework to help developers create custom Joomla extensions.

In September 2012, and after 3 years of hard work Nooku Framework 1.0 was released with support for Joomla 1.5, 2.5 and 3.x. After the 1.0 release our focus shifted to Nooku Platform - a fork of Joomla 1.5 - which we build for the Belgian Police.

In the summer of 2014 we decided to go back to our Joomla roots. We started working on Nooku Framework 2.0. Support for Joomla 1.5 was dropped and the framework got a complete refactor to make the architecture even leaner. One year, 2500 commits, 2000+ man hours, and many cups of coffee later it was ready.

## Joomlatools Developer Zone

After almost 7 years we are moving Nooku Framework back to [Joomlatools](http://www.joomlatools.com/), as [Joomlatools Framework](http://developer.joomlatools.com/framework.html).

Two years ago we released [developer.joomlatools.com](http://developer.joomlatools.com/). A dedicated area for Joomla developers with a set of free and open source Joomla development tools:

* [Composer](http://developer.joomlatools.com/tools/composer.html) - Extension installer for Joomla
* [Console](http://developer.joomlatools.com/tools/console.html) - Command line interface for Joomla
* [Vagrant](http://developer.joomlatools.com/tools/vagrant.html) - Preconfigured Vagrant box for Joomla

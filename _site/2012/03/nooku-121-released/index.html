<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.20236015669070184">Busy times in the Nooku Project. Contributions are literally pouring in. Things are moving so fast that I haven’t had the time to write about the 12.1 release that went out last month. Besides this being our first real release, lots of great code also made it in.</span></p>

<p>Sticking to our new 4 month release cycle we officially tagged Nooku 12.1 (/tags/12.1) in all our repositories on the <a href="https://nooku.assembla.com/">Nooku Developer Portal</a>. At the same time, we also moved the 12.2 release in the trunk (/trunk) and started the development of 12.3 (/branches/development).</p>

<h3 id="a-stable-first-release">A stable first release</h3>

<p>This first release is mostly a maintenance release. Lots of bugs and issues discovered after t<a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/10/nooku-07-alpha-4-released/">he last alpha</a> have been fixed. We also focussed on making sure that Nooku Framework is fully compatible with all Joomla versions up to 2.5.x.</p>

<p>The 1200 commits made by not less than <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/nooku/contributors?commit=Update&amp;query=&amp;sort=latest_commit">12 rockstar developers</a> from all over the world show how dedicated our community is to making Nooku solid and useable in a production environment. Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>Divided by 12 weeks, that’s an average of 108 commits/week or 21 commits a day. Not bad for ‘only’ a maintenance release!</p>

<h3 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h3>

<p>There is no backwards compatibility between releases. The changes between the 12.1 and alpha versions have been documented on the wiki.</p>

<p>If you are using Nooku Framework for public/commercial Joomla components, remember that you MUST update to 12.1! We will find you if you don’t ;)</p>

<h3 id="what-is-happening-next">What is happening next?</h3>

<p>With the 12.1 release out the door, our focus has now shifted to the testing and stabilisation of 12.2 (/trunk) and development of 12.3 (/branches/development). Work in trunk and development is done at the same time. This means the release of 12.2 is planned for May/June, while 12.3 will be released in Sep/Oct.</p>

<p>If you are using Nooku for your project, you can either contribute features to 12.3 or you can help with the testing and stabilizing of the 12.2 release.</p>
